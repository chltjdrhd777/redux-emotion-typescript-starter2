## 0. Update

v 0.1.0 : this is a first version of starter pack and the improvement of starter1

---

## 1. Description

This is a react starter with redux, typescript mainly.  
I really worried about how to setting react with redux fast.  
Whenever I delete and download packages and set the default structure repeatedly, I finally noticed that It is a waste of time(**_really_**)

So, I made this default setting, and I am gonna use this for my whole project.

## **and the difference from starter1**

    1.  removed 'normalize.css' and just add reset.css CDN because don't want to add more dependency
    2.  removed 'types' folder becuase I think setting types in each component like css is much better than set in the commonly used types folder according to the rules 'things should be disposed in the related place'
    3.  and also, I removed 'common.ts' for emotion css also to follow a relevent placing rule

## 2. How to use

It is simple. The only thing you should do is just

1. Make your own project folder

2. Open your terminal

3. If you don't have "git", please install it first, and type this on your terminal

```Bash
    $ npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```

you will see the whole latest react project are made.  
Then, you should delete

> a. public  
> b. src

After that, plaese download and unzip my gitrepository files, copy all, and paste them to your react folder

Finally, please enter

```
    $ npm install
```
